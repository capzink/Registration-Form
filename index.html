      <h3 class="section-header">Early life</h3>
      <p> Hideo Kojima was born on August 24, 1963, in Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan, and was the youngest of three children. His father, Kingo, named Kojima after the most common name among doctors he met. When he was four years old, his family moved to Osaka, Japan, for Kojima this was an abrupt change of environment, and he spent much of his time thereafter indoors, watching television. While the family lived in Osaka, his parents began a tradition of the family watching a film together each night, and he was not allowed to go to bed until the film had finished. 

Kojima took an interest in filmmaking when a friend brought a Super 8 camera to school. They began filming movies together, charging other children 50 yen to see them. Kojima tricked his parents into funding a trip to an island off the coast of Japan without telling them he wanted to film there. Instead of filming, he spent his time swimming, and on the last day changed the plot to being about zombies. He did not show the film to his parents.

When he was 13 years old, his father died. Kojima has discussed the impact of his father's death in interviews, and the subsequent financial hardship faced by his family.He enrolled at university to study economics, and it was there that he decided to join the video game industry.</p>

 <section id="Career">
      <h3 id="section-header">Career</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of his career, Kojima was initially searching for a way into film production. He hoped that, if he were to win awards for his written fiction, he would be approached about directing a film.with no support from friends or family he enter game development. He would frequently lie about his occupation in the early days of a career, when a word for game designer did not exist in the Japanese language, and instead told people he worked for a financial firm.

Kojima joined video game publisher Konami's MSX home computer division in 1986. He applied to Konami because it was the only games developer listed on the Japanese stock exchange.He was disappointed with the job initially, hoping to make games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and feeling that the 16 bit colour of the MSX was too restrictive. Games he worked on Penguin Adventure and Lost Warld.</p>
        
      <h4 id="section-career">Metal Gear and Snatcher (1987–1990)</h4>
      
<p>Kojima was asked to take over a project, Metal Gear, from a senior associate. Hardware limitations hindered the development of the game's combat, and Kojima altered the gameplay to focus on a prisoner escaping instead of fighting, inspired by The Great Escape. It was released on July 13, 1987, for the MSX2 home computer in Japan,and on September in that year for Europe.The player controls a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake, who is sent to the fortified state of Outer Heaven to stop a nuclear-equipped walking tank known as "Metal Gear". </p>
      
      <h4 id="section-career">Metal Gear 2 and Policenauts (1990–1994)</h4>
      The original Metal Gear was a commercial success for its release on the NES, and Konami decided to create a sequel to the game, Snake's Revenge, without the involvement of Kojima. When Kojima was riding on the Tokyo transit system, he was told about Snake's Revenge by a colleague working on the project, who asked him to make a new Snake game of his own. As a result, Kojima began work on his own sequel, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, and the two were both released in 1990. Kojima's game would not be released overseas in North America and Europe until its inclusion in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence (2006). Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake was a commercial success.</p>
      <h4 id="section career">Metal Gear Solid subseries and mainstream success (1994–2012)</h4>
      <p>In 1994, Kojima began to plan a 3D sequel to Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, titled Metal Gear Solid and originally planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. After the 3DO was discontinued, development shifted to the Sony PlayStation. For the transition from 2D to 3D graphics, a new engine had to be developed by Kojima and his team. A gameplay demo was first revealed to the public at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, and was later shown on day 2 of E3 1997 as a short video.The game was released to critical acclaim.</p>
      <h4 id="section-career">Final Konami projects and departure (2012–2015)</h4>
     <p> In mid-2012 and in the following years after Kojima finished work on the Fox Engine, Kojima has been connected to the Silent Hill series. During this time, he indicated that he was interested in making a Silent Hill game.</p>
      <h4 id="section-career">Independent studio and Death Stranding (2015–present)</h4>
      <p>On December 16, 2015, Kojima announced that Kojima Productions would be re-established as an independent studio, partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment, and that his first game would be exclusive to PlayStation 4. Kojima personally announced the game's title as Death Stranding in a trailer.The trailer featured Norman Reedus, whom Kojima had previously worked.
        Death Stranding was released on November 8, 2019, and became a commercial and critical success.</p>
